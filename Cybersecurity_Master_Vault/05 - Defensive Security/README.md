- Network defense techniques  
- Endpoint security configuration  
- Log analysis workflows  
- Detection engineering notes  

## Purpose
Develop hands-on defensive skills. all within the homelab by running simulations that mirror a real enterprise. Firewall setup/configuration, network management/maintain. within this homelab I can run any simulation I want, install a program with an open port, use offensive skills to search/scrap the network etc. Use defensive skills to prevent offensive attacks, etc.
