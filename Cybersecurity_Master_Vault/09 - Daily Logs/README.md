# Daily Logs

I use this section to document:
- Commands I run
- Problems I encounter and how I resolved them
- Scan results (Nmap, etc.)
- Configuration changes in any VM
- Screenshots or evidence of progress
- Attack attempts and their outcomes
- SIEM alerts generated from my own attacks (future)

This section serves as a real-world record of my cybersecurity journey and hands-on experience.
